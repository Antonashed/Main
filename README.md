East Way Solution — Static Landing
=================================

Structure:
- index.html
- assets/css/style.css
- assets/js/main.js
- assets/img/*

How to run:
- Open index.html in browser, or deploy to GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel.
- For GitHub Pages: push this repo and enable Pages on main branch (root).

Images:
- Replace assets/img/hero.jpg and assets/img/product.jpg with real photos.
- Suggested keywords: "cotton tote bag", "cotton bags warehouse", "tote bag product".
- Sources: Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay (free). For brand safety prefer paid stock.

Customization:
- Text is localized in Polish per TЗ.
- Colors are in :root CSS variables at top of assets/css/style.css.
- Countdown target: 03.12.2025 00:00 (local time) — adjust in assets/js/main.js if needed.
- Form isfaked: shows alert. For real submission integrate a backend or Netlify Forms / Formspree / webhook.

Notes:
- Comments added to JS/CSS for maintainability.
- If you want, I can integrate real images (upload here) or add Netlify Forms handling.
